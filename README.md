### <font color="lightblue">Introduction</font>
Out of our world’s population, around 39% of adults are overweight. The importance and need for exercising are evident from the above information. Exercise not only helps to reduce the body weight, but also if done regularly helps us stay active with good blood circulation and also to maintain a healthy weight, fit body and a peaceful mind. Visiting the gyms or attending yoga classes and getting trained under a trainer is not cheap and not affordable for all. Another option is self-training which will have the steps to do the yoga routine which is pre-recorded but lacks feedback. Without proper feedback about our postures, injuries can occur and it will do more harm than good and that's exactly where our project comes into play.
